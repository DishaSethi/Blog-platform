My major goal of this project was to learn implementing REST APIs , Sockets, JWT Cookies-based authentication by building backend and learning to call APIs from the Frontend using Axios.
All of this has been achieved so far, currently I am working on some minor changes left and Frontend UI and adding additional feautures. An ongoing Blog Platform project where:
 Features: 
 1.Create, Read, Update, Delete a blog 
 2. Authorization and Authentication 
3. Real-Time Commenting System.

Tech Stack Used: 
Frontend :

Backend:

Real time Commenting System:

 To start the project inside "src" folder do "npx nodemon server.js"
